👋 **Welcome in!** 👋

This repository contains the Open Source code for a Python Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) for developing plugins suitable for use on the `gliff.ai platform`_.

This repository aims to provide an easy-to-use Python environment for users to create their own plugins which they can then bring back onto the gliff.ai platform for the purposes of enhancing their development of imaging AI products. gliff.ai_’s SDK is just one supporting aspect of gliff.ai’s growing privacy-preserving MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) platform. When the full `gliff.ai platform`_ is used, gliff.ai’s SDK provides just one step in developing high-quality and auditable datasets that satisfy any relevant regulatory frameworks which enables our users to build world-changing and trustworthy AI models and products.

✅ **We welcome contributions on this repository!** ✅
